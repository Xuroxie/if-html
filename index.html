    <h2 >Why I choose front-end?</h2>
    <p>Front-end is the area responsible for turn into code and give life to that beautiful static design — put simply, it is the dev guy who takes care of your website's/blog's/web system's interface and usability; the CSS guy.</p>
    <p> Today we're living in the Information Age. And with a huge convergency for web apps and systems, great on-premises platforms are turning into cloud available applications.</p>
    <p>All this change plus those new services which already are born into the web ecosystem puts the <strong> <em> front-end developer role in evidence </em></strong> , leading to a huge demand for new trained developers to manage this all. A good front-end dev can make your product such an another result on Google search or make it a stand out, attractive result to your customers.</p>
    <p>Talking from the dev perspective, beyond the projects you would be taking part on and all the networking you'll develop, the front-end universe could offer you:</p>
    <p><h3> &#127775 Contact with fancy technologies </h3> <br> In the world of development, in general, you'll have contact with several and wonderful languages, tools and platforms <em> (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) </em> whose make your job easier and more flexible.
        Today it's such a mistake thinking that front-end development limits itself to HTML + CSS! The technical and knowledge level for front-end devs gets higher each day — to be a successfull dev, you must master HTML, CSS and JavaScript <strong> (only <em> jQuery </em> isn't enough!) </strong>, have a good design sense (it's a good differential if you have some experience with graphical software), have a good knowledge about projects architecture and infrastructure, design patterns (not everything in life is a <em> singleton</em>)… This list gets bigger every single day…</p>
    <p><h3> &#127775 Contact with a huge community </h3> <br> Today the web devs community (front + back) is very large and some fantastic people are inserted in those communities. Github, forums, Facebook + Telegram groups, there are several channels to knowledge's dissemination. It's very difficult to have a doubt or to find a problem which cannot be solved in a short amount time with such quality support.</p>
    <p><h3> &#127775 Acknowledgment and feedback </h3> <br> All the development segments have acknowledgement, logically. But I believe that it's such a front-end's glamour — <strong> the people really view and interact with your stuff. </strong> The users will click the button you've coded, they will like (or not) the website layout, animations and usability — and at this point the feedback is really fast!
        Any change you make will affect the user's navigation (either visual or performance stuff) and it can improve or worsen your website's or blog's conversion rate. All the actions made on the applications' visual layer (where front-end devs spent <del>100%</del> 90% of their time) will generate chain reactions that can be seen in short time slots.</p>
